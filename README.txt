 This project implements two Ethereum-based smart contracts—TransferCrypto and
 TimeLockedVault—that address key challenges in digital asset inheritance and secure,
 time-bound communication.
   1. Transfer Crypto Assets- A decentralized crypto asset inheritance system
    designed to automatically transfer ownership of digital assets to pre-assigned
    beneficiaries if the original owner becomes inactive beyond a specified time
    threshold. This approach removes the need for intermediaries like legal execu
    tors or custodians, ensuring a trustless and automated form of digital asset
    management that reflects a user's intentions even in unforeseen situations.

    2. Time Locked Message Vault- provides a secure, blockchain-based messag
    ing system where encrypted messages are stored and only become accessible
    after a predetermined unlock time. This ensures that sensitive or confidential
    information remains hidden from all parties until the specified time is reached,
    enabling use cases like timed disclosures, delayed instructions, or posthumous
    communication.

 -Technology used to develop our smart contracts is Solidity, on Ethereum blockchain.
 -Developed and tested smart contracts using Solidity in Remix IDE, a browser-based Ethereum development environment.
